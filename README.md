# Comparative-analysis-of-Classification-in-Data-Mining-using-R-Language-
Implemented various classification method :Naiive Bayes , Decision tree, Time Series decomposition, KNN algorithms. We chose these algorithms as they cover wide series of classification problems and our code determined best method out of these four algorithms for given user data input based on efficiency and accuracy.
